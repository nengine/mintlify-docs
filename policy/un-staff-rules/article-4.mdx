### Article IV – Appointment and Promotion

## Regulation 4.1

As stated in Article 101 of the Charter, the power of appointment of staff members rests with the Secretary-General. Upon appointment, each staff member, including a staff member on secondment from government service, shall receive a letter of appointment in accordance with the provisions of annex II to the present Regulations and signed by the Secretary-General or by an official in the name of the Secretary-General.

## Regulation 4.2

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer or promotion of the staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. Due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.

## Regulation 4.3

In accordance with the principles of the Charter, selection of staff members shall be made without distinction as to race, sex or religion. So far as practicable, selection shall be made on a competitive basis.

## Regulation 4.4

Subject to the provisions of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter, and without prejudice to the recruitment of fresh talent at all levels, the fullest regard shall be had, in filling vacancies, to the requisite qualifications and experience of persons already in the service of the United Nations. This consideration shall also apply, on a reciprocal basis, to the specialized agencies brought into relationship with the United Nations. The Secretary-General may limit eligibility to apply for vacant posts to internal candidates, as defined by the Secretary-General. If so, other candidates shall be allowed to apply, under conditions to be defined by the Secretary-General, when no internal candidate meets the requirements of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter as well as the requirements of the post.

## Regulation 4.5

- **(a)** Appointment of Under-Secretaries-General and of Assistant Secretaries-General shall normally be for a period of up to five years, subject to prolongation or renewal. Other staff members shall be granted either a temporary, fixed-term or continuing appointment under such terms and conditions consistent with the present Regulations as the Secretary-General may prescribe.

- **(b)** A temporary appointment does not carry any expectancy, legal or otherwise, of renewal. A temporary appointment shall not be converted to any other type of appointment.

- **(c)** A fixed-term appointment does not carry any expectancy, legal or otherwise, of renewal or conversion, irrespective of the length of service.

- **(d)** The Secretary-General shall prescribe which staff members are eligible for consideration for continuing appointments.

### Rule 4.3 – Nationality

- **(a)** In the application of the Staff Regulations and Rules, the United Nations shall not recognize more than one nationality for each staff member.

- **(b)** When a staff member has been legally accorded nationality status by more than one State, the staff member's nationality for the purposes of Staff Regulations and the Staff Rules shall be the nationality of the State with which the staff member is, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, most closely associated.

### Rule 4.4 – Staff in posts subject to local recruitment

- **(a)** All staff in the General Service and related categories, except as stipulated in staff rule 4.5 (c), shall be recruited in the country or within commuting distance of each office, irrespective of their nationality and of the length of time they may have been in the country. The allowances and benefits available to staff members in the General Service and related categories shall be published by the Secretary-General for each duty station.

- **(b)** National Professional Officers should be of the nationality of the country where the office concerned is located. National Professional Officers may be temporarily assigned outside of the country of their employment to a United Nations field mission for a period not exceeding three months or to any other duty station for a period not exceeding six months under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

### Rule 4.5 – Staff in posts subject to international recruitment

- **(a)** Staff members other than those regarded under staff rule 4.4 as having been locally recruited shall be considered as having been internationally recruited. Depending on their type of appointment, the allowances and benefits available to internationally recruited staff members, may include: payment of travel expenses upon initial appointment and on separation for themselves and their spouses and dependent children; relocation shipment; home leave; education grant; and repatriation grant.

- **(b)** Staff recruited locally at a duty station for posts in the Professional and higher categories at that specific duty station are considered internationally recruited but would generally not be entitled to some or all of the allowances and benefits mentioned in paragraph (a) above as determined by the Secretary-General.

- **(c)** Under special circumstances and conditions determined by the Secretary-General, staff who have been recruited to serve in posts in the General Service and related categories may be considered internationally recruited.

- **(d)** Staff members who have changed their residential status in such a way that they may, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, be deemed to be a permanent resident of any country other than that of their nationality may lose entitlement to home leave, education grant, repatriation grant and payment of travel expenses upon separation from service for the staff members and their spouse and dependent children and relocation shipment, based upon place of home leave, if the Secretary-General considers that the continuation of such entitlement would be contrary to the purposes for which the allowance or benefit was created. Conditions governing entitlement to benefits for internationally recruited staff in the light of residential status shall be set by the Secretary-General as applicable to each duty station.

### Rule 4.6 – Geographical distribution

Recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible, in accordance with the requirements of staff regulation 4.2, shall not apply to posts in the General Service and related categories.

The same modifications shall apply in the case of a staff member whose spouse is a staff member of another organization participating in the United Nations common system of salaries and allowances. Where both spouses are staff members and maintain separate households because they are assigned to different duty stations, the Secretary-General may decide to maintain such separate entitlements and benefits, provided that this is not inconsistent with any staff regulation or other decision of the General Assembly.
