### Article III – Salaries and Related Allowances (Part 1)

## Regulation 3.1

Salaries of staff members shall be fixed by the Secretary-General in accordance with the provisions of annex I to the present Regulations.

## Regulation 3.2 – Education grant

- **(a)** The Secretary-General shall establish terms and conditions under which an education grant shall be available to a staff member residing and serving outside his or her recognized home country whose dependent child is in full-time attendance at a school, university or similar educational institution of a type that will, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, facilitate the child's reassimilation in the staff member's recognized home country. The grant shall be payable in respect of the child up to the end of the school year in which the child completes four years of post-secondary studies or attains a first post-secondary degree, whichever comes first, subject to the upper age limit of 25 years. Admissible expenses actually incurred shall be reimbursed based on a sliding scale, subject to a maximum grant as approved by the General Assembly. Under conditions established by the Secretary-General, travel costs for the child of a staff member in receipt of assistance with boarding expenses and attending school at the primary and secondary levels may also be paid for an outward and return journey once in each scholastic year between the educational institution and the duty station. Such travel shall be by a route approved by the Secretary-General but not in an amount exceeding the cost of such a journey between the home country and the duty station.

- **(b)** Under conditions established by the Secretary-General, assistance for boarding-related expenses shall be provided to staff members serving in duty stations other than those classified as headquarters duty stations and whose children are boarding to attend school outside the duty station at the primary and secondary levels, at an amount approved by the General Assembly. The Secretary-General may establish conditions under which boarding assistance may exceptionally be granted to staff members serving at headquarters duty stations whose children are boarding to attend school outside the duty station at the primary and secondary levels.

- **(c)** The Secretary-General shall also establish terms and conditions under which an education grant shall be available to a staff member serving in a country whose language is different from his or her own and who is obliged to pay tuition for the teaching of the mother tongue to a dependent child attending a local school in which the instruction is given in a language other than his or her own.

- **(d)** The Secretary-General shall also establish terms and conditions under which an education grant shall be available to a staff member whose child is unable, by reason of physical or mental disability, to attend a normal educational institution and therefore requires special teaching or training to prepare him or her for full integration into society or, while attending a normal educational institution, requires special teaching or training to assist him or her in overcoming the disability. The amount of this grant per year for each disabled child shall be equal to 100 per cent of the education expenses actually incurred, up to a maximum amount approved by the General Assembly.

## Regulation 3.3 – Staff assessment

- **(a)** An assessment at the rates and under the conditions specified below shall be applied to the salaries and such other emoluments of staff members as are computed on the basis of salary, excluding post adjustments, provided that the Secretary-General may, where he or she deems it advisable, exempt from the assessment the salaries and emoluments of staff members engaged at locality rates.

- **(b)** The assessment shall be calculated at the following rates for staff members whose salary rates are set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of annex I to the present Regulations, and at the rates set out in the tables below.

- **(c)** In the case of a person who is not employed by the United Nations for the whole of a calendar year or in cases where there is a change in the annual rate of payments made to a staff member, the rate of assessment shall be governed by the annual rate of each such payment made to him or her.

- **(d)** The assessment computed under the foregoing provisions of the present regulation shall be collected by the United Nations by withholding it from payments. No part of the assessment so collected shall be refunded because of cessation of employment during the calendar year.

- **(e)** Revenue derived from staff assessment not otherwise disposed of by specific resolution of the General Assembly shall be credited to the Tax Equalization Fund established by Assembly resolution 973 A (X).

- **(f)** Where a staff member is subject both to staff assessment under this plan and to national income taxation in respect of the salaries and emoluments paid to him or her by the United Nations, the Secretary-General is authorized to refund to him or her the amount of staff assessment collected from him or her provided that the amount of such refund shall in no case exceed the amount of his or her income taxes paid and payable in respect of his or her United Nations income, and payments made in accordance with these provisions shall be charged to the Tax Equalization Fund.

## Chapter III – Salaries and related allowances

### Rule 3.1 – Salary scales

- **(a)** The Secretary-General shall publish the salary scales, pensionable remuneration and conditions of salary increments for all categories of staff members.

- **(b)** The Secretary-General may establish special conditions of employment applicable to language staff in the Professional category appointed for specific temporary assignments.

- **(c)** The transitional measures governing the salary scales and pensionable remuneration are subject to the provisions of staff rule 13.1 (Salary scales).

### Rule 3.2 – Salary step increments

- **(a)** Satisfactory service for the purpose of awarding a salary step increment shall be defined, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary-General in any particular case, by satisfactory performance and conduct of staff members.

- **(b)** Salary step increments shall be effective on the first day of the pay period in which the service requirements are completed. No step increment shall be paid in the case of staff members whose services will cease during the month in which the step increment would otherwise have been due.

- **(c)** If a staff member with satisfactory service changes level downwards, the period of service since the last step increment shall be credited towards the next step increment within the lower level.

- **(d)** If a staff member whose service has not been satisfactory is demoted to a lower level, the staff member's eligibility for salary step increment in the lower level will be based on satisfactory service at the lower level.

### Rule 3.3 – Salary policy

- **(a)** On appointment, or on selection to a different category, staff members shall normally be placed at the first step of the level of their post, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary-General.

- **(b)** On selection for a new position at a higher level within the same category, staff members who hold a fixed-term or a continuing appointment shall be placed at the lowest step of the level to which they have been assigned that provides an increase in net base salary equal to at least the amount that would have resulted from the granting of two steps at the lower level, unless otherwise decided by the Secretary-General.

### Rule 3.4 – Pensionable remuneration

- **(a)** The definition of pensionable remuneration is set out in article 51 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.

- **(b)** The pensionable remuneration of staff members in the Field Service category shall be established in the same manner as for staff in the Professional and higher categories.

- **(c)** When a staff member from the General Service and related categories is recruited to the Professional category and this results in a reduction of the pensionable remuneration, the level of pensionable remuneration reached prior to the change in category shall be maintained until it is surpassed by that applicable to the staff member's grade and step in the Professional category. Contributions payable shall be based on either the pensionable remuneration of the staff member used to determine such contributions at the time of change in category, or the pensionable remuneration applicable to the staff member's grade and step in the Professional category, whichever is higher.

### Rule 3.5 – Dependency allowances

#### Definitions

- **(a)** For the purposes of the Staff Regulations and Rules:

  - **(i)** A 'dependent spouse' is a spouse whose earnings, if any, do not exceed the lowest entry level of the United Nations General Service gross salary scales in force on 1 January of the year concerned for the duty station in the country of the spouse's place of work. In the case of staff in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category, the entry level amount referenced shall not at any duty station be less than the equivalent of the lowest entry level salary at the base of the salary system (G-2, step I, for New York).

  - **(ii)** A 'child' is any of the following children for whom the staff member provides main and continuing support:
    - a. A staff member's natural or legally adopted child; or
    - b. A staff member's stepchild who is residing with the staff member; or
    - c. A child who cannot be legally adopted, for whom the staff member has legal responsibility and who is residing with the staff member.

  - **(iii)** A 'dependent child' is a child for whom the staff member provides main and continuing support and who meets one of the following criteria:
    - a. The child is under the age of 18 years;
    - b. The child is between the ages of 18 and 21 years and attends university or its equivalent full-time; the requirement of residing with the staff member does not apply in this case;
    - c. The child is of any age and has a disability as medically determined by the Secretary-General as being permanent or for a period that is expected to be long-term that prevents substantial gainful employment.

  - **(iv)** Staff members claiming a child as a dependant must certify that they provide main and continuous support. This certification must be supported by documentary evidence under conditions established by the Secretary-General, if a child:
    - a. Does not reside with the staff member;
    - b. Is married; or
    - c. Is recognized as a dependant under subparagraph (a) (iii) c. above.

  - **(v)** A parent or a sibling of a staff member shall be considered as a secondary dependant if the staff member provides such a person with not less than half of that person's financial resources, and in any case with not less than twice the amount of the dependency allowance. The conditions regarding age, school attendance and disability are the same for a sibling as those applicable to a staff member's child in subparagraph (iii) above.

#### Amount of dependency allowances

- **(b)** The dependency allowances, which are applicable to the different categories of staff, shall be payable in accordance with the applicable rates published by the Secretary-General:

  - **(i)** Dependent spouse allowance: a dependent spouse allowance in the amount of 6 per cent of net base salary plus post adjustment shall be paid to a staff member in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category with a recognized dependent spouse, under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

  - **(ii)** Single parent allowance: a staff member in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category recognized as a single parent shall receive a single parent allowance in the amount of 6 per cent of net base salary plus post adjustment in respect of the first dependent child, under conditions established by the Secretary-General. A staff member who receives a single parent allowance in respect of the first dependent child shall not be eligible for payment of a child allowance for that child.

  - **(iii)** Dependent child allowance: eligible staff members shall receive a dependent child allowance for each recognized dependent child, under conditions established by the Secretary-General. Subject to the provisions of staff regulations 3.5 and 3.6 (a), the full amount of the dependency allowance provided under those regulations and under the Staff Rules in respect of a dependent child shall be payable, except where the staff members or their spouse receives a direct governmental grant in respect of the same child. Where such a governmental grant is made, the dependent child allowance or single parent allowance payable under this rule shall be the approximate amount by which the governmental grant is less than the dependent child allowance or single parent allowance set out under the Staff Regulations and Rules. No dependency allowance is payable if the governmental grant is equal to or exceeds the rate set out under the Staff Regulations and Rules.

  - **(iv)** Secondary dependent allowance: a secondary dependency allowance shall be paid in respect of not more than one secondary dependent and such payment shall not be made when a payment is being made for a dependent spouse. Staff members in the General Service and related categories shall receive a dependency allowance with respect to a secondary dependant when local conditions and/or the practices of comparator employers call for the establishment of such an allowance, under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

- **(c)** Staff members shall be responsible for reporting to the Secretary-General any change in the status of a dependant that may affect the payment of dependency allowances.

### Rule 3.6 – Post adjustment

- **(a)** Post adjustment is an amount paid to staff members serving in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category to ensure equity in purchasing power across duty stations.

- **(b)** While the salaries of staff members in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category are normally subject to the post adjustment of their duty station during assignments for one year or more, alternative arrangements may be made by the Secretary-General under the following circumstances:

  - **(i)** When staff members are assigned to a duty station whose post adjustment classification is lower than that of their previous duty station, they may continue to receive for up to six months the post adjustment applicable to the previous duty station while at least one member of their immediate family (spouse and children) remains at that duty station.

  - **(ii)** When staff members are assigned for three months or less to a United Nations field mission or for less than six months elsewhere, the Secretary-General shall decide whether to apply the post adjustment applicable to the duty station and to pay entitlements applicable when there is a change of official duty station or, in lieu of the above, to authorize appropriate payments of the daily subsistence allowance.
