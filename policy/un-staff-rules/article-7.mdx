  - (ii) In the case of a deviation for personal convenience, annual leave shall be deducted for absence on working days at the official duty station of the staff member falling outside of the official business travel period.

- (c) The Secretary-General may, in exceptional and compelling circumstances, authorize a reasonable increase in the daily subsistence allowance to be paid to staff members who are required to accompany a senior official and whose official duties while in travel status require that their additional living expenses be set at a rate substantially higher than the established rate.

- (c) (i) The Secretary-General may establish and publish special rates of daily subsistence allowance for the purposes of the settling-in grant for specific categories of staff at various duty stations.
