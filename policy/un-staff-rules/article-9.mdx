#### Regulation 9.3

- **(a)** The Secretary-General may, giving the reasons therefor, terminate the appointment of a staff member who holds a temporary, fixed-term or continuing appointment in accordance with the terms of his or her appointment or for any of the following reasons:

- **(c)** If the Secretary-General terminates an appointment, the staff member shall be given such notice and such indemnity payment as may be applicable under the Staff Regulations and Rules.

The Secretary-General may waive this requirement if in the opinion of the Secretary-General there are exceptional or compelling reasons for doing so.

#### Rule 9.12 — Repatriation grant

##### Purpose

- **(a)** The purpose of the repatriation grant provided by staff regulation 9.4 is to assist in the re-establishment of expatriate staff members in a country other than the country of the last duty station, provided that they meet the conditions contained in annex IV to the Staff Regulations and in this rule.

##### Definitions

- **(b)** The following definitions shall be used in ascertaining whether the conditions contained in annex IV to the Staff Regulations and this rule are met:

  - **(i)** 'Country of nationality' shall mean the country of nationality recognized by the Secretary-General.

  - **(ii)** 'Dependent child' shall mean a child recognized as dependent under staff rule 3.5 (a) (iii) at the time of the staff member's separation from service.

  - **(iii)** 'Home country' shall mean the country of home leave entitlement under staff rule 5.4 (Home leave) or such other country as the Secretary-General may determine.

  - **(iv)** 'Obligation to repatriate' shall mean the obligation to return a staff member and eligible family members, upon separation, at the expense of the United Nations, to a place outside the country of the last duty station at the time of separation.

  - **(v)** 'Qualifying service' shall mean five years or more of continuous service on a fixed-term or continuing appointment and residence away from the home country and the country of nationality of a staff member, or the country where the staff member has acquired permanent resident status.

##### Eligibility, amount and computation of the grant

- **(c)** Staff members who are internationally recruited pursuant to staff rule 4.5 shall be eligible for payment of the repatriation grant in accordance with the amount set forth in annex IV to the Staff Regulations, provided that they meet the following conditions:

  - **(i)** The Organization had the obligation to repatriate the staff members upon separation from service after qualifying service as defined in staff rule 9.12 (b) (v).

  - **(ii)** The staff members resided outside their home country and country of nationality while serving at the last duty station at the time of separation.

  - **(iii)** The staff members have not been dismissed or separated from service on grounds of abandonment of post.

  - **(iv)** The staff members do not have permanent resident status in the country of the duty station at the time of separation.

- **(d)** When both spouses are staff members and each is entitled to payment of a repatriation grant on separation from service, the amount of the grant paid to each spouse shall be calculated in accordance with terms and conditions established by the Secretary-General.

##### Payment of the repatriation grant

- **(e)** Payment of the repatriation grant after separation of an eligible staff member shall require submission of documentary evidence satisfactory to the Secretary-General that the former staff member has relocated away from the country of the last duty station at the time of separation.

- **(f)** When a staff member receives a new appointment in the United Nations common system less than 12 months after separation, the amount of any payment for repatriation grant shall be adjusted so that the number of months, weeks or days of salary to be paid at the time of the separation after the new appointment, when added to the number of months, weeks or days paid for prior periods of service, does not exceed the total of months, weeks or days that would have been paid had the service been continuous.

- **(g)** In the event of the death of an eligible staff member, no payment shall be made unless there is a surviving spouse or one or more dependent children whom the United Nations is obligated to repatriate. If there are one or more such survivors, payment shall be made under terms and conditions established by the Secretary-General.

##### Time limitation for submission of the claim

- **(h)** Entitlement to the repatriation grant shall cease if no claim has been submitted within two years after the effective date of separation, or under conditions established by the Secretary-General. However, when both spouses are staff members and the spouse who separates first is entitled to the repatriation grant, the claim for payment of the grant by that spouse shall be considered receivable if made within two years of the date of separation of the other spouse.

#### Rule 9.13 — Last day for pay purposes

- **(a)** When a staff member is separated from service, the date on which entitlement to salary, allowances and benefits shall cease shall be determined according to the table below.

| Reason for separation | Last day for pay purposes |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|

Annual leave will be granted during the period of notice only for brief periods |
| Abandonment of post | The date of the decision by the Secretary-General that the post has been abandoned by the staff member or the date of expiration of the appointment specified in the letter of appointment, whichever is earlier |

- **(b)** When an internationally recruited staff member has an entitlement to return travel under staff rule 7.2 (a) (viii), this shall not affect the determination of the last day for pay purposes in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above. In the case of resignation, expiration of temporary or fixed-term appointment, termination or retirement, the staff member shall be paid, on separation, an additional amount for days of authorized travel estimated on the basis of uninterrupted travel by an approved route, mode and standard of travel from the duty station to the place of entitlement to return travel. Such amount shall be calculated as is done for the commutation of accrued annual leave under staff rule 9.10 above.

#### Rule 9.14 — Certification of service

Any staff member who so requests shall, on leaving the service of the United Nations, be given a statement relating to the functions performed and the length of service.
