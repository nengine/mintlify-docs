#### Duration

- **(d)** The duration as regulated under staff regulation 3.2 on the education grant may be extended if the child's education is interrupted for at least one school year by mandatory national service, illness or other compelling reasons.

#### Amount of grant

- **(e)** The amount to which a staff member may be entitled under the grant is set out in appendix B to the present Rules.

- **(f)** The amount of the grant to be paid when the staff member's period of service or the child's school attendance does not cover the full school year shall be prorated under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

#### Travel

### Rule 3.10 – Special post allowance

- **(a)** Staff members shall be expected to assume temporarily, as a normal part of their customary work and without extra compensation, the duties and responsibilities of higher-level posts.

- **(b)** Without prejudice to the principle that selection to a higher-level position under staff rule 4.15 (Senior review bodies and central review bodies) shall be the normal means of recognizing increased responsibilities and demonstrated ability, staff members holding a fixed-term or continuing appointment who assume the full duties and responsibilities of a post at a clearly recognizable higher level than their own for a temporary period exceeding three months may, in exceptional cases, be granted a non-pensionable special post allowance from the beginning of the fourth month of service at the higher level.

- **(c)** In the case of a staff member holding a fixed-term or continuing appointment who is assigned to serve in a mission, or when a staff member in the General Service category is required to serve in a higher-level post in the Professional category, or when a staff member in any category holding a fixed-term or continuing appointment is required to serve in a post which is classified more than one level above the staff member's level, the allowance may be paid immediately when the staff member assumes the higher duties and responsibilities.

- **(d)** The amount of the special post allowance shall be equivalent to the salary increase (including post adjustment and dependency allowances, if any) which the staff member would have received had the staff member been promoted to the next higher level.

### Rule 3.11 – Mobility incentive

- **(a)** The purpose of the mobility incentive is to encourage movement of staff members to duty stations classified as A to E in accordance with the classification of duty stations established by the International Civil Service Commission.

- **(b)** Staff members in the Professional and higher categories, in the Field Service category, and internationally recruited staff in the General Service category pursuant to staff rule 4.5 (c) may be paid a non-pensionable mobility incentive provided that they:

  - **(i)** Hold a fixed-term or continuing appointment; and

  - **(ii)** Are on an assignment of one year or more to a new duty station classified as A to E by the International Civil Service Commission; and

  - **(iii)** Have served for five consecutive years or more on a fixed-term or continuing appointment in the United Nations common system of salaries and allowances.

- **(c)** The mobility incentive shall be discontinued upon five continuous years at the same duty station. In the exceptional case of staff members who remained at the same duty station for more than five years at the explicit request of the Organization or for compelling humanitarian reasons, the mobility incentive shall be payable for one additional year, but in no case for more than a total of six years.

- **(d)** The amount of the mobility incentive, if any, and the conditions under which it will be paid, shall be determined after taking into account the number of duty stations at which staff members have previously served for a period of one year or longer and the hardship classification of the new duty station to which staff members are assigned.

### Rule 3.12 – Hardship allowance

- **(a)** The purpose of the hardship allowance is to compensate for the hardship experienced by staff members serving in duty stations classified as B to E by the International Civil Service Commission.

- **(b)** Staff in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category, and staff in the General Service category considered internationally recruited pursuant to staff rule 4.5 (c) who are appointed or reassigned to a new duty station may be paid a non-pensionable hardship allowance.

- **(c)** The amount of this allowance, if any, and the conditions under which it will be paid shall be determined by the Secretary-General taking into account the degree of difficulty of life and work at each duty station in accordance with the classification of duty stations established by the International Civil Service Commission.

### Rule 3.13 – Non-family service allowance

- **(a)** The non-family service allowance is an incentive for staff members to undertake assignments at non-family locations and recognizes the increased level of financial and psychological hardship incurred by involuntary separation from their families, including additional service-related costs.

- **(b)** Staff in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category and staff in the General Service category considered internationally recruited pursuant to staff rule 4.5 (c) who are appointed or reassigned to a non-family duty station may be paid a non-pensionable non-family service allowance.

- **(c)** The amount and conditions under which the allowance will be paid shall be determined by the Secretary-General. When a duty station has been designated as non-family, the presence of eligible family members of the staff member shall not be authorized at the duty station, unless exceptionally approved by the Secretary-General. In no event shall the allowance be payable if the Secretary-General has exceptionally approved the presence of eligible family members of the staff member at the duty station.

### Rule 3.14 – Salary advances

- **(a)** Salary advances may be made to staff members under the following circumstances and conditions:

  - **(i)** In cases where new staff members arrive without sufficient funds, in such amount as the Secretary-General may deem appropriate.

  - **(ii)** In exceptional and compelling circumstances, and if the request of the staff member is supported by a detailed justification in writing.

- **(b)** Staff members who have not been receiving an allowance, grant or other payment to which they are entitled shall not receive retroactively such allowance, grant or payment unless the staff members have made a written claim within one year following the date on which the staff member would have been entitled to the initial payment, except in the case of the cancellation or modification of the staff rule governing eligibility, in which case the written claim must be made within three months following the date of such cancellation or modification.

### Rule 3.16 – Deductions and contributions

- **(a)** Staff assessment shall be deducted, each pay period, from the total payments due to each staff member, at the rates and subject to the conditions prescribed in staff regulation 3.3.

- **(b)** Contributions of staff members who are participating in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund shall be deducted, each pay period, from the total payments due to them.

An incentive payment for the recruitment of experts in highly specialized fields in instances in which the Organization was unable to attract suitably qualified personnel may be made under conditions to be prescribed by the Secretary-General.
